## How to Convert Decimal Numbers to Binary
### Jimmy Scowden
### This tutorial will teach you how to convert decimal numbers to binary
### This tutorial is aimed towards students in INFOTC1600

#### STEP 1: Take your decimal number and divide it by two. Write down the remainder.
#### STEP 2: Repeat step one, with the answer you got from step one as the quotient. Keep writing down the remainders.
#### STEP 3: Eventually you will get 0 as the quotient. At this point, write down your remainders in reverse order from which you started.
#### STEP 4: Voila! You have converted a decimal number to binary.

### Need an example?

#### Example: We are going to use decimal number 29 for our example. 29/2 is 14 with remainder 1. 14/2 is 7 with remainder 0. 7/2 is 3 remainder 1. 3/2 is 1 remainder 1.  1/2 is 0 remainder 1. Now that we have 0 for the quotient, we need to write down our remainders in reverse order. We get 11101 for our binary number!
#### This means that decimal 29 is equal to 11101 in binary!

### Another example?

#### Example 2: We are going to use decimal number 57. 57/2 is 28 remainder 1. 28/2 is 14 remainder 0. 14/2 is 7 remainder 0. 7/2 is 3 remainder 1. 3/2 is 1 remainder 1. 1/2 is 0 remainder 1. Now we write the remainders in reverse order to get 111001 for our binary number
#### This means that decimal 57 is equal to 111001 in binary!

### One more example?

#### Example 3: We are going to use decimal 71. 71/2 is 35 remainder 1. 35/2 is 17 remainder 1. 17/2 is 8 remainder 1. 8/2 is 4 remainder 0. 4/2 is 2 remainder 0. 2/2 is one remainder 0. 1/2 is 0 remainder 1. Now we write the remainders in reverse order to get 1000111 for our binary number!
#### This means that decimal 71 is equal to 1000111 in binary!

### Now you know how to convert decimal numbers to binary!
